# Hair brush helper
A simple two minute timer where you pick a character with messy hair and their hair graduaually gets neater. 

You can set some background music or alternatively add your own local music (or just play something in the background)

## Possible enhancements
I'm not planning to change anything unless needed, but some ideas to park for later:
- better accessibility support (if this is something that you'd find useful, then please do get in touch)
- adjust timer legnth
- package it up as an "app" and share on an app store
- connect to API to generate custom set of characters on the fly
